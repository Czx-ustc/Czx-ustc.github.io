I am currently a third‑year Ph.D. student (2022 – now) in the Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. Tianzhu Zhang and Prof. Baoqun Yin. I spent my M.Eng. studies at the Advanced Technology Research Institute, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and received my B.Eng. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020. My research interests include computer vision, multimodal learning, and image-to–point cloud registration.

**Adaptive Agent Selection and Interaction Network for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration**  
Zhixin Cheng, Xiaotian Yin, Jiacheng Deng, Yujia Chen, Bohao Liao, Wenfei Yang, Baoqun Yin  

We propose an adaptive agent selection and interaction framework that dynamically identifies informative regions and models agent-level interactions for robust image-to-point cloud registration, especially under large viewpoint and modality gaps.
