I am currently a third‑year Ph.D. student (2022 – now) in the Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. Tianzhu Zhang and Prof. Baoqun Yin. I received my M.Eng. degree from the Advanced Technology Research Institute, USTC in 2022 and my B.Eng. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.

My research interests include computer vision, multimodal learning, and 2D‑3D image–point cloud registration.
